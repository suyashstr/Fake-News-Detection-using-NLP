# Fake-News-Detection-using-NLP
This repository contains a Python implementation of a fake news detection system using a Passive Aggressive Classifier. The project visualizes fake and real news distributions, identifies top authors, and evaluates the model's accuracy.

## Background:-
The spread of misinformation and fake news has become a significant concern. This project aims to address this problem by developing a system that can automatically classify news articles as fake or real. This can be valuable for individuals and organizations to filter out misleading information.

## Concepts Used:-
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF): TF-IDF is used to convert text data into numerical feature vectors. It weighs the importance of words in a document relative to a collection of documents.

Passive Aggressive Classifier: The Passive Aggressive Classifier is a type of online learning algorithm that efficiently learns from data streams. It's suitable for text classification tasks and adapts well to large datasets.
